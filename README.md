## How to use

Enter your tasks in the input field and click "Add task" to add them
to the list. Once you have added all your tasks, click "Rate grid" to
create the rating matrix.
Click on the cells in the rating matrix to pick between two tasks. The
selected task's rating will rise. The task list is sorted by rating.
Once you have rated all tasks against each other, start from the first 
task in the list and work your way down.
